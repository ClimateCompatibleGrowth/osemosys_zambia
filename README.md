# OSeMOSYS-Zambia

This repository currently only contains the input data of OSeMOSYS-Zambia for the reference scenario. A future update will include more detailed input data and model documentation.


- OSeMOSYS-Zambia-WESM-reference-scenario.zip is the model file for the reference scenario that can be imported in the OSeMOSYS user interface (developed by UNDESA).
- OSeMOSYS-Zambia-WESM-reference-scenario.txt is the basic data file for the reference scenario.
- OSeMOSYS-preprocessing.txt is the model file that is used in conjunction with the data file.

To add the model to the UI, download the .zip file and import it through the "Restore model" button in the Home tab.
