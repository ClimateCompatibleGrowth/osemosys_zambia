# OSeMOSYS-Zambia
For the moment the repository stores the .zip files required to restore a model in the UNDESA-developed user interface.
To add the model to the UI, download the desired .zip file and import it through the "Restore model" button in the Home tab.

- UI_Zambia_v2l_reference_full.zip is the model with all 0s as generated from the clicSAND excel file
- UI_Zambia_v2l_reference_light.zip is the clean version of the model as generated through clicSAND.exe
